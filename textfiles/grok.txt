The student-to-faculty ratio is 40:1, providing a structured learning environment. For students struggling academically, the college supports them through educational loans and merit-based scholarships. Faculty members are accessible outside of class, available in their cabins during college hours. The grading system uses CGPA to evaluate student performance. The college is equipped with different types of advanced laboratories and research facilities to enhance practical learning. To change majors or specializations, students should contact their faculty in-charge for guidance. Many courses offer specialized tracks, and details can be found on the college website. Lab sessions are integrated into the curriculum to improve students’ hands-on experience. A capstone project, worth 6 credits, is required for third- and fourth-year students, while opportunities for dual-degree programs, such as minor courses, are available—students can refer to the college website for more information. Faculty members conduct research frequently, and students can participate based on available vacancies.

Living off-campus is an option, with many choices available, though students are advised to seek suggestions from seniors for careful selection. Hostel facilities are provided for all students, including NRI and international students. For internships, the college provides letters of recommendation, and students can consult their faculty for details. Mock interview sessions are offered both virtually and offline to prepare students for placements. Recent graduates typically secure high-paying jobs across various sectors, with a placement rate of around 91%. However, the college does not assist with networking skills, leaving it entirely to the students. Companies recruit on campus annually for final-year students. Networking opportunities with alumni are facilitated through events like Career Chronicles, where students can learn about hiring processes from different companies. A mandatory course on resume building and interview preparation is part of the curriculum. Scholarships specifically for engineering students are awarded based on academic merit. Part-time job opportunities are available around campus, and the college supports students with financial difficulties through merit-based scholarships.

For ECE students, lab courses are available based on their enrolled specialization, with various labs such as networking, VLSI, and other electronics-focused facilities. Dedicated spaces for engineering design and innovation offer hands-on experience with tools like AutoCAD and 3D software. Students can access different software licenses using their college email ID, and lab equipment and technology are updated regularly to stay current. Computer labs with specialized software are provided based on course requirements, and Wi-Fi is accessible throughout the campus. The engineering department participates in various technical and non-technical competitions held throughout the year. Students can propose new clubs or organizations when recruitment opens or if their unique idea is approved by professors. Volunteering opportunities exist through NGOs within the college, and extracurricular projects like hackathons are frequently organized by various clubs. Study abroad programs are offered in different countries, and students should contact the respective faculty for details.

The college has a well-equipped library with various books and study spaces, including a designated study area on the first floor of UB. To check book availability, students can visit the online library platform. Wellness programs, such as marathons and outdoor activities, are conducted to encourage engineering students’ physical health, and psychological support is available through one-on-one sessions. Coding and programming skills are taught as part of the curriculum, with additional activities to promote learning. International students benefit from a diverse campus environment, and while students are friendly and communication can occur in English, specific language support services are not detailed beyond this.
